Postal codes beginning with M (except M0R and M7R) are located within the city of Toronto in the province of Ontario. Only the first three characters are listed, corresponding to the Forward Sortation Area.\n\nCanada Post provides a free postal code look-up tool on its website, via its applications for such smartphones as the iPhone and BlackBerry, and sells hard-copy directories and CD-ROMs. Many vendors also sell validation tools, which allow customers to properly match addresses and postal codes. Hard-copy directories can also be consulted in all post offices, and some libraries.\nWill use Scarborough dataset which we scrapped from wikipedia on Week 3. Dataset consisting of latitude and longitude, zip codes.\n\nNote: There are no rural FSAs in Toronto, hence no postal codes should start with M0. However, a handful of individual special-purpose codes in the M0R FSA are assigned to Gateway Commercial Returns, 4567 Dixie Rd, Mississauga as a merchandise returns label for freepost returns to high-volume vendors such as Amazon and the Shopping Channel.\n\n<b>Most populated FSAs</b>\n\nM1B, 65,129\n\nM2N, 60,124\n\nM1V, 55,250\n\nM9V, 55,159\n\nM2J, 54,391\n\n<b>Least populated FSAs</b>\n\nM5K, 5\n\nM5L, 5\n\nM5W, 5\n\nM5X, 5\n\nM7A, 5"

Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n1. Neighborhood\n2. Neighborhood Latitude\n3. Neighborhood Longitude\n4. Venue\n5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n6. Venue Latitude\n7. Venue Longitude\n8. Venue Category"
